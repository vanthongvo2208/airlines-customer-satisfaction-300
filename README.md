🎓 [POWER BI PROJECT] AIRLINES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION – VISUALIZING THE EXPERIENCE OF 130,000 PASSENGERS

I'm thrilled to share my first data analytics project—completed as the final project for the Power BI course at Datapot!



📘 Report Overview

This dashboard analyzes survey data from 130,000+ passengers of simulated airline Invistico Airlines, focusing on:

 ▪ Satisfaction by service (check-in, meals, Wi-Fi…)

 ▪ Passenger demographics & travel behavior

 ▪ Key factors like delays and flight distance



🎯 Objectives of the Report:

 ✅ Identify dissatisfied customer segments

 ✅ Analyze pre-flight and in-flight services

 ✅ Measure the impact of flight delays and travel distances

 ✅ Recommend improvements by customer group



🧰 Power BI Tools & Techniques Used

Data cleaning, Data modeling, DAX (Satisfaction rate, delay classification, distance classification, service quality averages), Conditional formatting, Tooltips, Intuitive Dashboard visuals: cards, bar/pie charts, slicers.



🔍 Key Insights from the Data

1. Moderate Overall Satisfaction

▪ Only 54.73% of passengers were satisfied; 45.27% were not → service quality needs improvement

2. Most Dissatisfied Segments

▪ Males aged 20–50, business travelers, Economy Class, and disloyal customers

▪ Female business travelers also show high dissatisfaction → unmet expectations

3. Weakest Service Areas

▪ Seat comfort (2.8/5), food and drink (2.9/5) are the lowest-rated services

▪ Check-in and gate info also cause issues (3.0–3.3 scores)

4. Strong Impact from Delays

▪ Delays >60 mins: over 56% dissatisfaction

▪ Even 15–60 mins: >50% dissatisfied

▪ On-time flights still see 42.77% dissatisfaction → service quality gaps

5. Flight Distance Affects Experience

▪ Medium-haul: 61.6% of passengers, but only 49.15% satisfied

▪ Short- and Long-haul: ~63–65% satisfaction → better service alignment



🛠️ Solutions & Recommendations

1. Short-term

▪ Upgrade Economy seat comfort (width, cushioning, recline)

▪ Enhance food and drink quality

▪ Add more check-in staff and improve gate info displays

▪ Handle delays better: SMS/email alerts, meal vouchers for long delays



2. Long-term

▪ Personalize services by segment (e.g., age, purpose)

▪ Use Power BI to monitor real-time satisfaction

▪ Train staff: focus on friendliness, communication and customer empathy during delays

▪ Focus on retaining loyal customers (31.82% still dissatisfied)



💡 Lessons & Skills Gained

▪ Service quality must be consistent throughout the travel experience

▪ Delays are important, but seats and meals impact satisfaction just as much

▪ Smart questions + proper analysis reveal hidden issues behind the numbers

▪ Gained hands-on experience with DAX for dynamic KPIs

▪ Learned multidimensional analysis using slicers and drillthrough
